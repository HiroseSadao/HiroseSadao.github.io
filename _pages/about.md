Sadao Hirose (廣瀬貞雄) is a third-year undergraduate student in the Department of Mechano-Informatics, Faculty of Engineering, at the University of Tokyo. His main project during his undergraduate years has been to find ways to make soccer teams stronger using data. To pursue this goal, he joined the University of Tokyo’s official soccer team as a data scientist, conducted research on optimal positioning, and is currently working on a project analyzing brain states just before kicking the ball. Recently, while continuing to engage in soccer-related projects, his academic focus has increasingly turned to neuroscience, an area of interest he has had since high school, with a particular interest in the realization of brain inspired computing systems.
